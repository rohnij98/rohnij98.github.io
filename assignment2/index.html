<!-- Aim for this assignment was to build a revamped version of the media player using the partial code provided. 
  I decided to go choose the music video context to build my media player around. I wanted to add icons to increase the appeal and 
  engagement of the media player. I picked play, pause, no audio, full screen and repeat icons as I felt they would be the
  most appropriate options. -->
  
  <!-- To build on the feedback I received for my previous assignment, I focused on picking a colour scheme which would add to the 
  visual appeal of the media player while giving it a sophisticated look. I decided on a colour combination of beige, coffee colour
and a darker coffee colour and assigned these 3 colours to different sections to increase the visual appeal and also added some 
Seeing as I was going to add some level of interactivity to the site, I also added a teal colour which would be visible when the user
would hover their mouse over the navigation tabs. and added padding to give the playe more polished look. -->

<!-- Made use of java script to ad interactivity to the media player. Main funtion of the javascript was to assign interactive functions to 
icons to increase user engagement. Added the icon links from the icons8 website and used function tab to integrate the icons and 
add the desired interactivity. Also made used of the addeventlistener syntax to attach an event handler to specified functions.
for example: play/pause button: this event will be triggered when the user clicks on the button and the funtion toggles between 
play and pause. Repeated the process to assign specific funtions to all the events.-->
