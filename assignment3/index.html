<!--
    My goal was to create a user experience which would aid the user to easily browse the products and get a description of the product without having to go to a different page. This tailored interactivity experience was designed to increase engagement and enhance user experience while interacting with the page. This interaction is designed for a fast fashion shopping website with a focus on the hover function. 
Design Choices and Context Explanation
1. Colour Scheme and Visual Hierarchy:
•	Header and Navigation:
o	A dark background with white text creates a strong visual contrast, making the menu easy to distinguish and also adds a level of sophistication to the page.
o	On hover, the background becomes slightly lighter, giving the user clear visual feedback.
•	Dropdown Menu:
o	The dropdown menu has a background colour matching the hover state of the menu item, maintaining a consistent colour theme.
o	Links within the dropdown brighten further on hover, indicating interactivity.
•	Product Grid:
o	Products are displayed on a light background with white product containers, ensuring focus on the product images and information.
2. Hover Interactivity:
•	Menu Hover:
o	When the user hovers over a menu item, the dropdown appears seamlessly, providing a list of product categories.
o	This interaction guides the user to explore different parts of the website without overwhelming them.
•	Product Hover:
o	Product images scale up slightly on hover, and the product info panel slides up from the bottom with a fade-in effect.
o	This ensures that the user can quickly get more information about the product without navigating away or clicking.
3. Responsive Design:
•	Flexbox Layout:
o	Both the menu and product grid utilize Flexbox for responsive alignment.
o	This ensures that the layout adapts well to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across all devices.
4. JavaScript Enhancements:
•	Dynamic Content Update:
o	JavaScript is used to dynamically update the product information on hover.
o	This keeps the HTML code clean and allows for easier updates when product information changes, enhancing maintainability.
Challenges and Future Implementation
1.	Performance Optimization:
o	As the number of products and menu items grows, performance may be impacted.
o	Implementing lazy loading for images and optimizing the JavaScript can help maintain smooth interactions.
2.	Accessibility:
o	Ensuring full accessibility involves adding ARIA roles and making sure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable.
o	This would make the site usable for a broader audience, including those with disabilities.
3.	Enhanced Features:
o	Search Functionality: Adding a search bar in the header for quick product searches.
o	User Accounts and Personalization: Allowing users to create accounts and receive personalized recommendations.
o	Advanced Animations: Implementing more sophisticated animations for a richer user experience, such as transitions between product categories or animations for adding products to the cart.
