       <h2> 1)	What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>

The first thing that stands out while interacting with the experience is the striking colours used in the web page with the intention of instantly catching the users attention. The colour of the text used in the web page seems appropriate and in line with the overall colour scheme. There is no difficulty in discerning the text on screen

        <h2>2)	Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
        </h2>

        After spending time on the website, it became clear that the web page was created to promote the individual and their skills as a designer. The interactivity of the website has been executed seamlessly. When the user moves the mouse around, the colours and text change seamlessly to inform the user more about the designer. When you scroll down there are interesting graphics and effects throughout the webpage viz. pixel displacement effect. Interactivity of the web page has been well executed with the hover mechanics linked to the designer’s contact details and relevant links.

            3)	What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
        </h2>
        The part I spend most time interacting with was the pixel displacement effect they have on the webpage. It was a good fun element to interact with which has been well executed, keeps the user engaged and also displays the skills of the designer. One of the other features I s pend time interacting with is the change in colour and text as the user hovers the mouse which is another fun way to increase engagement.

        4)	What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?
    </h2>
    The most common action in my two-minute interaction with the webpage was interacting with the pixel displacement effect. It is a clever way to keep the user engaged by offering them something captivating and displaying your skills as a designer at the same time.

    <h2>5)	What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
 </h2>
 The main goal of this website is to create a page where the creator can display their skills and share information about themselves and their passions. They have created this page with a lot of creativity and interactivity which is designed to immediately engage the user and further their cause as a designer. The colour scheme they have chosen for this greatly helps their case. 
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6)	How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
    As this web page is dedicated to inform about the designer’s passion towards website design, it certainly hits the mark as the user is immediately greeted by a short introduction about the designer itself with scroll mechanics and good colour scheme. As the user scrolls down, they are greeted with different effects and animations in the websites which display the designer’s skills and makes the website fun to use. Overall the designer has maximized the output of their website to make sure that any suer will have an enjoyable experience.

    <h2>7)	What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
    In my opinion, the design of the website is intended for a short-term use. As the website opens, the user gets a short introduction about the designer. When they scroll down, they get a quick demonstration of the designer’s skillset. And then the user is directed towards the contact details of the designer. Which indicates that the website is simply means for the designer to give the users a quick introduction of themselves and their skills and make it so that the users can get in contact through various available platforms.

<section>
    <h2>8)	How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
    This particular website in my opinion is not designed to bring users back time and time again. The purpose of this website is to simply display what the designer is capable of and give the users or potential clients means to get in contact with the designer. 
</section>

<section>
    <h2>9)	What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
    The design on first look references a wacky feel to the website especially considering the colour scheme the designer has chosen. Also taking into consideration the animation and the effects the designer has elected to incorporate in their webpage, it is clear that the designer has elected to align with a wacky, funky style yet, the layout of the webpage is extremely neat and sophisticated.

    <h2>10)	What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
    These references play an important role in user experiences by leveraging the user’s emotions, narratives, etc to create a dynamic and engaging user experience. Whenever users experience something, they are familiar with eg: colours, pop culture references, TV shows/ books references, it helps to create more satisfying user experiences.

    <h2>11)	What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
    Any website is designed to invoke an emotional response within the user. Whenever a user interacts with any website the colour scheme, layout of the website or some images in the background, there is something that the user feels connected to which guides their user experience and helps creating a dynamic interaction.

    <h2>12)	What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
    One of the most frustrating parts of interacting with a website is when there is too much clutter on the page, and there is no clear flow guiding the user to their end product. For example, if the user is on a shopping site and is looking for something in particular, then having too many ads and not a clear layout harms the user experience as the user will find it frustrating to search for the product they are looking for and won’t be keen to return to your site.

    <h2>13)	What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
    One of the most satisfying parts of any interaction is clean layouts on the webpage with soothing colour scheme and smooth transitions between different pages. All these things combine to create a good and satisfying user experience. Choosing an appropriate colour scheme helps invoke an emotional response from the user and a clean layout makes it easier for the user to interact with the site, which in turn will encourage them to return to the site.

<!-- To start creating my code, my aim was to keep the layout simple as to make it easier for any user to read and interact with the content.I started writing the code with the aim to create a single scrolling page. 
after the first 2 headers, I put all the remaining text in my main body and further divided it into sections. I tried to create a box layout around each answer, but unfortunately the combinations I tried were fitting well and somehow made my code go haywire. So in the end I chose to go with the sectioned layout. -->
